     <h1> The Beginning</h1>
            Born January 6, 1972 in the states and shortly after moving to Nigeria. Ndubisi Ezerioha was destined for great things. The son of a scientist, it is simply in his genes. At the young age of 15 he was already taking college courses in his parentsâ€™ home country of Nigeria. These weren't regular studies either. He attended Anambra State University of Technology majoring in Petrochemical Engineering. After a year of schooling in Nigeria, at the age of 16, he moved by himself to Southern California and transferred to Cerritos College to further his education in 1989. Obtaining his associate degree, with Honors, in Applied and Natural Science. It was while he attended Cerritos College that he was first bitten by the mod bug. At the time he owned a 1988 Honda CRX HF that he was able to purchase with the help of his parents. Due to a faulty muffler, young Bisi was forced to replace it. At this time period, compact Japanese cars were not very popular, so the muffler shop suggested a muffler that would have been more suitable for a muscle car. None the less, Bisi fell in love with the intoxicating sound of his new exhaust. First, only being concerned with maximizing fuel economy, he now wanted to go faster! With simi-stripped interior and spare tire removed, his engineering mind knew what was next, a new intake system. There was a problem however, there were no readily available intakes for his car since the tuning scene was in its infancy. No big deal for Bisi! He went and purchased the largest filter he could and took it back to the same muffler shop, having them weld him a transition section in his intake tract to mate to the throttle body on his engine. Vuala, custom intake system and more awesome sound. His car was the fastest thing around, so he thought. He was easily beaten in a street race by a car full of girls in a si version of the same CRX. What an embarrassing event but at that moment he vowed to have the fastest CRX in the world!

     <h1>From the Street to the Strip</h1>
          He then attended California State University Long Beach to obtain a Chemical Engineering and Engineering Management degrees. Meanwhile racing and learning more about making his CRX faster at Terminal Island race track in Long Beach and the street races in Compton. With so little available for these cars, Bisi was at ground zero and the forefront of modifying them. Finding hotrod magazines about V8's he would use these strategies and technologies to apply them to his smaller inline 4 carbureted engine to squeeze out all possible power. Even with all the hatred towards his choice in vehicle from the V8 crowd, Bisi remained dedicated. Now working in pharmaceutical research and sales and tinkering with cars as a hobby, Bisi was making a name for himself in the street racing scene and started competing in professional events. He was also making so much money in pharmacy that he was able to buy his own dyno and facility in Pomona where he would tune peoples naturally asperated Honda engines and sold his custom header. This proved to be so successful that he decided to open his shop to the public in 2006. He was growing bored in the corporate world and would give this a shot for 2 years. well, that 2 years is going on 11 now.

  <h1> BISIMOTO ENGINEERING</h1>
  Located in Ontario CA, Bisimoto Engineering has grown from a place where Bisi worked on his personal cars to a well respected shop with engine building, engine calibration, chassis design, parts fabrication and testing. Well respected is an understatement, in 2013 Complex named his shop as number 6 on the top 20 import tuning shops in the country. Countless appearances in tuner magazines, record setting passes in single cam carbureted Honda's that stand today, builds featured in video games along with movies, Bisi is truly an icon in the tuning scene. His shop specializes in naturally aspirated Hondas but one look at the shops site and you will see that they are well verse and will tackle any job from Vipers to Porsches.
